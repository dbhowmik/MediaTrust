                    <p>Sabrina Caldwell is a senior lecturer and researcher at The Australian National University. Her area of research interest centers on images, specifically photo credibility. Key to her research is the important distinction between photographs (photos of real people, places and events) and manipulated images or photoart (images created or changed by image manipulation software and/or Artificial Intelligence). She works in the area of physicological signal processing using neural networks, deep learning and bio-inspired computing, particularly as it pertains to human recognition of deception and affective reasoning. She is a member JPEG Committee; Co-chair of JPEG Trust and Co-editor of new international JPEG ISO standard on image credibility under development.</p>
