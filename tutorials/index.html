			<h4 align="right">27th - 30th October 2024, Abu Dhabi, UAE</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Due to the success of technologies such as Generative AI and mobile phone cameras, recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale media content creation and consumption. While progress in this space opens up new opportunities, especially in creative industries,  this also enables problematic issues in cyberspace, including cyber attacks, piracy, fake media distribution, and concerns about trust and privacy. Misuse of manipulated media evidently caused social unrest, spread rumours for political gain, or encouraged hate crimes in the recent past. </p>

			<p>Media modifications are not always negative, as they are increasingly a normal and legal component of many production pipelines, and even new knowledge production. However, in many application domains, creators need or want to declare the type of modifications that were performed on the media asset. A lack of such declarations in these situations may reveal the lack of trustworthiness of media assets or worse, the intention to hide the existence of manipulations. </p> 

			<p>Such a need triggered an initiative by JPEG committee to standardize a way to annotate media assets (regardless of the intent) and securely link the assets and annotations together. This <a href="https://jpeg.org/jpegtrust/">JPEG Trust</a> standard (to be released in 2024) ensures interoperability between a wide range of applications dealing with media asset creation and modification, providing a set of standard mechanisms to describe and embed information about the creation and modification of media assets. </p>

			<p>This tutorial aims to present an in-depth understanding of the upcoming JPEG Trust international standard, including a limited but core hands-on coding exercise on the implementation and several use case scenarios. </p>

                    <p>This session will focus on the details of the JPEG Trust standard and its framework, establishing that a media asset consists of the media asset content, media asset metadata, and a Trust Record. The framework intends to ensure the media asset’s integrity, authenticity, provenance and privacy - thus establishing the basis for trust in the media. The topics will follow the details of this standard, which include 1) JPEG Trust framework, 2) Media asset life cycle annotations, 3) Embedding and referencing, 4) Identification of assets and actors, 5) authentication and integrity and 6) Privacy and Protection. </p>

The live coding will use a mix of pre-populated functions and GUI demonstrating the implementations of prototypical functionalities of the JPEG Trust standard. </p> 
					<p>Our aim is to achieve an improvised learning outcome through this participant-centred, problem-based demonstration session. Participants will be at the heart of this session and will also get the opportunity to develop their understanding through peer learning and informal conversations with the presenters on various topics relevant to the JPEG Trust standard. </p>
