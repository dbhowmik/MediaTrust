			<h4 align="right">27th - 28th November 2024, Glasgow, UK</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially Generative AI, for media creation and manipulation enable users to produce near-realistic media content that is almost indistinguishable from authentic content to the human eye. These developments open a multitude of opportunities, from creative content production, the art industry, and digital restoration to image and video coding. However, they also risk infringing copyrights and spreading manipulated media, such as deepfakes, which often lead to social unrest, the spread of rumours for political gain, or the encouragement of hate crimes.</p>
			<p>The workshop aims to solicit papers and talks addressing the current advances in trustworthy media generation, distribution and consumption. </p>
			
            <h3><strong>Call for papers (Deadline: 25 August 2024)</strong></h3>
            <hr>
            <p>We invite you to submit your latest research to present in this workshop.

Key to her research is the important distinction between photographs (photos of real people, places and events) and manipulated images or photoart (images created or changed by image manipulation software and/or Artificial Intelligence). She works in the area of physicological signal processing using neural networks, deep learning and bio-inspired computing, particularly as it pertains to human recognition of deception and affective reasoning. She is a member JPEG Committee; Co-chair of JPEG Trust and Co-editor of new international JPEG ISO standard on image credibility under development.</p>
